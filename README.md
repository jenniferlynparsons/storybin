# About the project
Storybin is a submission management application for use by literary magazines.

## Project Overview

### Stack
- Ruby on Rails 5.0
- PostgreSQL
- JQuery (required for some gems)
- Bulma CSS framework

### Development progress

- Current version: 0.0
- [Project board](https://trello.com/c/udgG86Qa)

### Goals
Storybin should be a user-friendly app for managing short story submissions as itâ€™s main goal.
Additionally, I want to use it as a platform for learning and developing my skills in Rails and Ruby.

### Roles
Users fall into three categories:
* Submitters - can only view their own submissions and works and the statuses of the submissions. Additionally they can view Author comments on submissions.
* Editors - Can view all submissions and interact with them, voting and adding comments
* Admin - Can create Issues, manage Users, and accept/reject stories.
Additionally, any of these users may have subcategories of user for translators (Authors), slush readers (Editors), and assistant admins (Admin).

### Features
#### Users
* registration
* CRUD submissions
* CRUD works

#### Editors
* Vote on submissions
* View submission links
* Comment on submissions
* Tag submissions with genres
* View dashboard of recent comments and votes
* Filter submissions by status and assignment

* Assign submissions
* Accept and reject submissions
